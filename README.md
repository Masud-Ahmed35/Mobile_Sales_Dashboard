# Mobile_Sales_Dashboard

I've successfully designed and implemented a Mobile Sales Dashboard using Power BI, and I'm incredibly proud of the insights it provides.

This interactive dashboard allows for in-depth analysis of:

📊 Key Performance Indicators: Total Transactions, Total Quantity, Total Sales, and Average Sales.

📈 Sales Trends: Visualizing sales by month, quarter, and even comparing to the same period last year.

🌍 Geographical Insights: Understanding sales distribution by city.

✅️ Payment & Rating Analysis: Breaking down transactions by payment method and customer rating status.

📳 Model Performance: Identifying top-performing mobile models.
